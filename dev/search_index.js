In the JSON3 package, there are two main interfaces for interacting with these JSON types: 1) builtin and 2) struct mapping.

For a JSON Object, it will return a JSON3.Object type, which acts like an immutable Dict, but has a more efficient view representation. For a JSON Array, it will return a JSON3.Array type, which acts like an immutable Vector, but also has a more efficient view representation. If the JSON Array has homogenous elements, the resulting JSON3.Array will be strongly typed accordingly.

JSON3 employs a novel technique inspired by the simdjson project, that is a semi-lazy parsing of JSON to the JSON3.Object or JSON3.Array types. The technique involves using a type-less \"tape\" to note the positions of objects, arrays, and strings in a JSON structure, while avoiding the cost of materializing such objects. For \"scalar\" types (number, bool, and null), the values are parsed immediately and stored inline in the \"tape\". This can result in best of both worlds performance: very fast initial parsing of a JSON input, and very cheap access afterwards. It also enables efficiencies in workflows where only small pieces of a JSON structure are needed, because expensive objects, arrays, and strings aren't materialized unless accessed. One additional advantage this technique allows is strong typing of JSON3.Array{T}; because the type of each element is noted while parsing, the JSON3.Array object can then be constructed with the most narrow type possible without having to reallocate any underlying data (since all data is stored in a type-less \"tape\" anyway).","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"The JSON3.Object supports the AbstactDict interface, but is read-only (it represents a view into the JSON source input), thus it supports obj[:x] and obj[\"x\"], as well as obj.x for accessing fields.

Data types tend to be \"collection of fields\" kind of types; fields are generally public and directly accessible, they might also be made to model \"objects\" in the object-oriented sense.

A lot! For data types, the most typical JSON representation is for each field name to be a JSON key, and each field value to be a JSON value.

Sometimes a type is just a \"wrapper\" around an internal type that has a well defined representation, be that data or interface. Sometimes, we're just in the middle of developing something and our structs are just not that well defined. StructTypes.CustomStruct provides a bit of an \"escape hatch\" of sorts in that we get explicit \"hooks\" into the pre-serialization and pre-deserialization steps when calling JSON3.read(json, T). These are available via the StructTypes.lower(x::T) and StructTypes.lowertype(::Type{T}) methods. The former will be called on any type with the StructTypes.CustomStruct trait before serializing, and then serializing will continue anew on whatever was returned, hence StructTypes.lower needs to return or transform x::T into something that also has a well-defined StructType trait. So our custom type T can essentially be serialized however we want by whatever we return from StructTypes.lower. StructTypes.lowertype works similarly, but for deserialization. We defined a mapping from our custom type to the type of object that should first be deserialized, which will then be passed to our type's StructType.construct method.

StructTypes.OrderedStruct() is less flexible, yet more performant. For reading a StructTypes.OrderedStruct() from a JSON string input, each key-value pair is read in the order it is encountered in the JSON input, the keys are ignored, and the values are directly passed to the type at the end of the object parsing like MyType(val1, val2, val3). Yes, the JSON specification says that Objects are specifically un-ordered collections of key-value pairs, but the truth is that many JSON libraries provide ways to maintain JSON Object key-value pair order when reading/writing. Because of the minimal processing done while parsing, and the \"trusting\" that the Julia type constructor will be able to handle fields being present, missing, or even extra fields that should be ignored, this is the fastest possible method for mapping a JSON input to a Julia structure. If your workflow interacts with non-Julia APIs for sending/receiving JSON, you should take care to test and confirm the use of StructTypes.OrderedStruct() in the cases mentioned above: what if a field is missing when parsing? what if the key-value pairs are out of order? what if there extra fields get included that weren't anticipated? If your workflow is questionable on these points, or it would be too difficult to account for these scenarios in your type constructor, it would be better to consider the StructTypes.Struct or StructTypes.Mutable() options.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"The slightly less performant, yet much more robust method for directly mapping Julia struct fields to JSON objects is via StructTypes.Mutable().

If certain fields need to be intialized or zeroed out for security, then this should be accounted for in the constructor). For these mutable types, the type will first be initizlied like MyType(), then JSON parsing will parse each key-value pair in a JSON object, setting the field as the key is encountered, and converting the JSON value to the appropriate field value. This flow has the nice properties of: allowing parsing success even if fields are missing in the JSON structure, and if \"extra\" fields exist in the JSON structure that aren't apart of the Julia struct's fields, they will automatically be ignored.
